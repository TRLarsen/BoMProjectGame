This project was created for the class Teachings and Doctrine of the Book of Mormon taught by Ryan Sharp at Brigham Young University Winter 2025. 
It represents my appreciation for the gospel of Jesus Christ as taught in the Book of Mormon in a simple, gamified way. I testify of Jesus Christ. He is risen.

Project uses Python 3.13, with extensive use of the Pygame Library. Credit goes to Pygame and additionally to David Clark (unaffiliated) for his text rectangle module https://www.pygame.org/pcr/text_rect/index.php -.
